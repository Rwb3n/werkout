Recommended Technology Stack
Our front-to-back implementation will be built on these core technologies:
Frontend

Framework: Next.js (provides SSR, routing, and API routes)
CSS Framework: Tailwind CSS (for rapid UI development with utility classes)
State Management: React Context + SWR (for efficient data fetching/caching)
Form Handling: React Hook Form + Zod (performance-focused with type safety)

Backend

Framework: Node.js + Express (JavaScript consistency across stack)
Database: MongoDB (flexible schema ideal for evolving requirements)
Authentication: Clerk (managed service for user management and authentication flows)
File Storage: AWS S3 (reliable cloud storage for media)

Deployment

Frontend: Vercel (optimized for Next.js)
Backend: AWS Elastic Beanstalk (scalable with reasonable operational overhead)
CI/CD: GitHub Actions (tight integration with code repository)

Implementation Strategy

Start with Core UI Components & Design System

Establish Tailwind configuration with custom colors, spacing, etc.
Build reusable UI components (buttons, inputs, cards, modals)
Create responsive layouts and container components
This provides the visual foundation for all subsequent development


Develop Authentication & User Profiles

Implement registration/login interfaces
Build profile creation flows for both fitness seekers and providers
Set up JWT authentication backend
Create user database models and API endpoints
This establishes the identity framework for the platform


Implement Location-Based Search

Integrate Google Maps for location selection
Build search interface with filters
Create backend geospatial queries in MongoDB
Implement results display components
This enables the core discovery functionality


Build External Platform Integration

Create OAuth flows for connecting to Instagram, TikTok, Strava, etc.
Implement token storage and management
Build content synchronization services
Create components for displaying external content
This differentiates the platform with cross-platform integration


Develop Community Features

Implement events calendar and event creation
Build group functionality
Create success stories components
This builds the engagement layer of the platform



The hyperlocal aspect will be emphasized through:

Location-based search with smaller default radius (1-3 miles)
Location prominently displayed in all trainer/group listings
Map-based discovery interfaces
Geolocation features to find nearby opportunities

By starting with the frontend components and progressively building the backend services to support them, we maintain a user-centric development approach while ensuring that the integration points between social platforms are carefully designed from the beginning.
