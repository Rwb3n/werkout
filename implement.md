## Key Front-to-Back Development Principles

1. **Component-First Development**: Build reusable components before full pages
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Ensure core functionality works even if advanced features fail
3. **Continuous Integration**: Frequently integrate frontend and backend components
4. **Early User Testing**: Get feedback on UI components as early as possible
5. **API Contract Enforcement**: Establish and strictly maintain API contracts between frontend and backend
6. **Performance Budgeting**: Set performance targets and test against them throughout development
7. **Mobile-First Implementation**: Design and build for mobile experience first, then enhance for larger screens
